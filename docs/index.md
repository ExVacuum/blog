# Code, Coffee, and Camus

Welcome to my blog!

My name is Silas Bartha, and I am a computer science student and hobbyist developer living in Canada.
Aside from my main pastime of software development, I have various other interests that I'm pursuing. 

This blog was created in order for me to share whatever's got my attention at the moment,
be it my thoughts some new philosophical concept I'm exploring, a tutorial for implementing some bizzare mechanic
in one of my games, or even just random tangents. Whether you're here to read some of my eccentricities, 
or just misclicked a search result, welcome!

A list of entries will appear in the navigational pane as they are created, so be sure to check back often!
