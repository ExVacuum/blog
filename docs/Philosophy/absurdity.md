# Disillusionment, Existential Dread, and the Absurd

## Preface

One area of philosophy I find particularly interesting is metaphysics, the study of the fundamental nature of the universe. 
I also happen to have an obsessive compulsion to reason through a problem until I can find resolution. One unfortunate consequence of this is
the inevitable encounter of ideas that completely reshape your outlook on life. This article serves as a way to share my own journey over
the course of the last few years, from the metaphysical positions of my parents to the nervous mess that types before you now.

## Disillusionment

Disillusionment is essentially the feeling of disappointment you get when you realize something you strongly believed to be true is definitely or likely false.
Disillusionment varies in severity depending on the scale of the shift.

Disillusionment manifested in my own life very strongly around the age of 14. I had been raised, up to this point, in a Baptist Christian household which adhered
to a fairly strict form of biblical literalism, and I 100% believed everything that I had been taught during my childhood, and believed that I had a personal 
relationship with God. I also believed a number of completely absurd propositions, such as young-Earth creationism, rejection of evolution, and flood geology. I had been so carefully taught not to stray from the path of righteousness... 
but I was curious. 

I was curious as to why evolution and the ancient age of the Earth were taught in schools with no alternatives, as all of the creationists that surrounded me were constantly fear-mongering
 about how the advancements made in our understanding of the universe were part of a global conspiracy to obscure the truth. I wondered why none of them seemed to really know why
 these things were so widely accepted in the scientific community. And so, I decided that I would hear the other side out. After all, surely if what I believed was true, which I knew it was,
 then I had nothing to worry about and could reasonably counter the opposition. I had no idea that this would be the start of a year-long journey of deconversion that saw everything I thought I new
 reduced to nothing. Once I discovered the impossibility of a global flood 4000 years ago, or how incredibly robust and credible evolution by natural selection really was, I realized that I didn't have good
 reasons to believe the things that I did. This led to a full re-examination of my beliefs, and I realized that I had become an atheist. 
 
I have always had a good relationship with my family, and I am very fortunate that they were accepting of me as I entered this stage in my life. But in my mind, the disillusionment that I had experienced was
leading to more and more doubt about everything I held to be true. Disillusionment is not a pleasant state of mind to be in whatsoever, and this drove me to seek the truth, whatever it may be.

## Existential Dread

My experiences of disillusionment left me just a simple seeker, on a spirit quest to discover... What doth life? Examining various different metaphysical systems continuously led to disappointment. I was searching for meaning I so
desperately desired, yet I was unable to find any anywhere I looked. But I couldn't go back to the comforting beliefs I once held. I was stuck in a nihilistic default state, and I would have rather believed anything else.

I could not stop imagining the moment of my own death, my ceasing to exist. This is a concept that is impossible for a sentient being to imagine, and I find it terrifying, perhaps more so than anything else I can imagine. Of course, 
there is no logical reason to fear death, but the mere inability to comprehend nonexistence occasionally triggers intense panic attacks. The realization of my own fleeting experience, combined with my desire for a higher purpose to life, 
have placed me into a quagmire of fear and existential dread.

## The Absurd

This existential dread essentially defines what the philosopher Albert Camus, the namesake of this blog, called the Absurd. Humans exist in a tragic state of yearning for meaning in a meaningless universe. Any attempt at assigning meaning
ultimately falls through once examined. Camus illustrates this in *The Myth of Sisyphus* through an interpretation of the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a cruel king
damned to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll down, for eternity. Camus realized that Sisyphus' endless, futile toil is much like that of every human going about their meaningless lives until they cease to exist.
He also stated that it was only tragic once it was conscious. These were the moments when Sisyphus returned down the hill to restart his task, and for humans, it is when we realize of the ultimate absurdity of our futile existence.

And yet, Camus thought Sisyphus could be happy. In the fact of his own futile fate, Sisyphus acknowledges the hopelessness of his own existence, and keeps on pushing. Once realizing the absurdity of his existence, Sisyphus was able to become the "Absurd Hero",
the one who can bravely stand in the face of complete hopelessness and smile. For, as Camus put it: "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn". Camus believed that this same principle was applicable to humanity much in the same way,
that we too could be brave like Sisyphus. Whether we can truly become the absurd hero or not, we have something Sisyphus never had. We have each other, and together we can at least find ways to enjoy this futile existence while we have it.
